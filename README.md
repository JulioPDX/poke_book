# Poke Book

Playing with the pokeapi to generate a Pokemon trainers book.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JulioPDX/poke_book.git
cd poke_book
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/active
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 create_pdf.py
```

## Why?

I am pretty comfortable working with REST APIs and I've wanted to play with the pokemon API for a while now. I recall reading pokemon trainer books as a kid and wanted to take a shot at creating one with python. This is the result of that inspiration. There is a lot of room for improvement but this is more of a proof of concept of what is possible.
